          I am a driven college graduate with a background in exercise science, now pursuing a career in software engineering. Currently enrolled in the Springboard software engineering bootcamp, I’m excited to apply my new skills and knowledge in real-world environments. Transitioning from exercise science to software engineering has shifted my mindset, allowing me to embrace new challenges with flexibility and determination. My passion for helping others continues to fuel my journey, and I’m always eager to take on new tasks and learn. Feel free to explore my portfolio or reach out to me via email for any questions!
